              COmeeda cannot succeed without the help of its Volunteer's. We here at COmeeda recognize this, and do all we can to make sure our Volunteers are set up for success and have everything they need to do so. We are here 24/7 to help with any issues or to answer any questions you may have. If you're interested in helping with our efforts to fight hunger, then please consider joining our movement and become a Volunteer. <br><br>
              We are currently looking to build a volunteer base for when COmeeda goes live. If you have any interest in becoming a volunteer, please email our Executive Direct, Omar Castro, at ocastro@comeeda.org, or our Director of Operations, Brian Dumoulin, at bdumoulin@comeeda.org. Please pass your enthusiasm on to friends and family and encourage them to jump on board with the future of food donation to help COmeeda help fight hunger.

              Once COmeeda is ready to operate, one of our coordinators will reach out and you are now ready to log-in to our app and make your first delivery. Once logged in, you will get a push notification when one of our partners has excess food that is ready to be picked up and delivered. If you are in the area and have time to do a pick up and delivery, simply click on the notification and accept the pick-up. We will then notify the donor that you are on your way and our map will give you point-by-point directions on where the donor is located and where you need to drop off the food. Fighting hunger has never been this easy!<br><br>
              Through our app, we'll provide you with your own Dashboard where you can track the amount of pickups, miles driven, and hours volunteered, for your convenience. We do our best to take care of our volunteers and based off the amount of pickups and hours volunteered, you'll be added to our "All-star" team where you'll receive social media recognition and exclusive gifts that have been donated to COmeeda. If you are the competetive type, you will even be able to see how you stack up against other COmeeda volunteers.

              COmeeda’s goal is to alleviate hunger in the Denver Metro Area by soliciting, collecting, growing and packaging food in conjunction with distributing it through a network of service agencies and partners that serve our target group. COmeeda is an application that works in conjunction with similar nonprofit organizations in Denver and surrounding Counties, to aggregate our volunteers in one network. Our partners will have the opportunity to use one application to connect with hundreds of local volunteers that are currently available to pick-up food and deliver it to the nearest shelter or food bank. COmeeda receives support from the county, charitable organizations, grants, and corporate sponsorships. COmeeda’s co-founder’s include: Omar Castro (Executive Director), Brian Dumoulin (Director of Operations), and Steven Halase (Director of Engineering).<br><br>
              Our client base include low-income individuals and families who need emergency assistance to feed their families. It is estimated that nearly half of those that can benefit from COmeeda are children and young adults under the age of 18 years. COmeeda actively solicits food from local growers, retailers, wholesalers, restaurants, caterers, technology companies, and grocery stores for immediate distribution to local nonprofits like COmeeda, homeless shelters and food banks.  <br><br>
